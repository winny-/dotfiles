#+startup: indent
* winny's dotfiles

Not much to see here yet. I link stuff in with:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ./tool install MODNAME
#+END_SRC

Or if you're feeling ballsy you can link everything at once:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ./tool install modules/*
#+END_SRC

** Extension ideas

*** Add pre/post-link and pre/post-unlink hooks

Useful for fixing permissions (e.g. =.ssh= should be =0700=). Useful
for templated files. Useful for creating/deleting host-specific files.

** Folder structure

- modules/ :: the modularized configs. Each module is a directory.

** Module structure

- image/ :: the files to symlink into the homedir.
- hooks/install/* :: executable scripts to run after successful stow
  invocation.
