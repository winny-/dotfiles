* winny's dotfiles

[[file:misc/winny-dotfiles.png]]

[[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]] powered dotfiles.  Keep it simple, keep it easy to manage.  But don't
keep it [[https://drewdevault.com/2019/12/30/dotfiles.html][too simple]], for I need host-specific file support (same filename,
different content across many hosts) and script execution after successful Stow
invocations.

I link stuff in with:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ./tool install MODNAME
#+END_SRC

Or if you're feeling ballsy you can link everything at once:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  make install
  # Or if your GNU Make is too old:
  ./tool install modules/*
#+END_SRC

** Project structure

- modules/ :: the modularized configs.  Each module is a directory that follows
  the module structure layout.  Browse available modules [[file:modules/][here]].

*** Module structure

Each module is a directory tree installable via =./tool install MODNAME=.  The
module's directory [[man:basename(3)][basename]] doubles up as the module's name.

- image/ :: the files to symlink into the homedir.
- hooks/install/* :: executable scripts to run after successful stow
  invocation.
- README.md :: describe the module's scope, dependencies and caveats.

** Hooks

Little bits of code ran during =./tool= operations.  These code clippings
are useful for fixing permissions (e.g. =.ssh= should be =0700=).  Could also
manage out host-specific files.

*** Hook variables

The following environment variables are available from hook scripts:

- =TARGET= :: where files are installed to, i.e. your =$HOME= (=~/=).
- =MODULE= :: The module folder name, e.g. =tmux=, =alacritty=, =bash=.

*** Install hook

Drop an executable file into the module's =hooks/install/= folder then rerun
=./tool install modname=.

*** Examples

- Set up host specific =mpv= configuration file ([[file:modules/mpv/hooks/install/ensure-platform-conf-exits.sh][link]]).
- Set up a symlink for Alacritty's automatic dark/light mode support ([[file:modules/alacritty/hooks/install/ensure-valid-theme-symlink.bash][link]]).

** Wishlist

*** Add complete pre/post-link and pre/post-unlink hooks

In addition to the present "run hook after install" or "post-link" hook,
pre-link and pre/post-unlink hooks may have utility.  Wait and see.  Implement
when a need is found.

*** Rewrite =tool= in Perl 5

Rewrite =tool= in Perl 5 and use the GNU Stow API directly.  Allow for easier
maintenance in future.

** FQA (Frequently questioned answers)

*** Why not home-manager?

1. It depends on the nix ecosystem and thereby limits target deployment
   environments severely.
2. More abstractions mean more stuff to learn and keep in mind when working on
   this project.  *Excessive cognitive burden is a self-inflicted curse
   experienced many computer users.* I should not buckle under the loading of
   my personal dotfiles project.
3. nix is designed by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremely_online][terminally online]] computer fans who don't understand that
   sometimes you just want the thing to work without Internet access.
4. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_novelty][Just because something is shiny doesn't make it good or smart]].

*** How to ignore files?

It depends.  Review out a couple examples.

- [[file:modules/mg/.gitignore]] ([[man:gitignore(5)][see manpage]])
- [[file:modules/mpv/.gitignore]]
- [[file:modules/scripts/image/.stow-local-ignore]] ([[info:stow:Types And Syntax Of Ignore Lists][see infopage]])

*** Why not do X or Y or Z?

[[https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png]]

Probably works good.  Try it for yourself!
